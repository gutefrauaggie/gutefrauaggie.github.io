Goal:

- Single-page quiz with a multiple-choice question, 4 possible answers and a feeback system for telling the user if they were correct or not.
- Next and Prev buttons dynamically load the other questions and answers

How:
- questions and answers are stored in a 2D array in JS
- Q is index 0 in the array, Correct Answer is index 1, Wrong Answers are index 2,3,4
- Answers are shuffled then sent to DOM
